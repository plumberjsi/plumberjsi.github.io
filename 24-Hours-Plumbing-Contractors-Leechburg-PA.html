<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
