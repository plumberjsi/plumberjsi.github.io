<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to get away. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
