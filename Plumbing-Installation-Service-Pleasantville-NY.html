<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated annually. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an every year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated every year to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
