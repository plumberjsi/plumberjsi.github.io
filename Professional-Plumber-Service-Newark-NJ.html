Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove recorded ions.</p>

Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
