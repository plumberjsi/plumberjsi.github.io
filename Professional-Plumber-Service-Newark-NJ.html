<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to eliminate tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure known as Design template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that will not adhere to any surface in your house, keeping your home appliances and hot water heaters free of hard water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove recorded ions.</p>

This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
