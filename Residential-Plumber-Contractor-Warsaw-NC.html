A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
