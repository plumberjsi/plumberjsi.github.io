Waste disposal unit warranties last approximately 5 years, but they can vary in between 2 and 10 years. Considering that the average life-span of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you might want to buy an extended guarantee. Most guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures.
