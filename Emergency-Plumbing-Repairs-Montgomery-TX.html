For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.

These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
