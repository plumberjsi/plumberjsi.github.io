I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
