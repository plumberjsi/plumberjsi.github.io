<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>

There are sections including Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing specialists in their day tasks at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal investigations on the show. Additionally, a Roto-Rooter van is shown in the opening section of each episode. For some homes, water softening is only part of the solution.

<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to ruin micro-organisms and supply purified water. The energy source needed to heat up the water is more economical. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water hardness can be eliminated relatively quickly by using an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations describe favorably charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
