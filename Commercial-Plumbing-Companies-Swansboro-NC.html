A modern community water system system is created to make sure that water flows to properties and structures under pressure. This community water network consists of many users where there is a risk to public health if there is a cross-connection in between the water supply and a polluted source. A cross-connection can take place where there is a pressure drop in the water pipe. This pressure drop causes a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the public water system.</p>
