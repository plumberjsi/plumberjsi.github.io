<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Clifton VA!</h3>
<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this short area of pipe before it can reach the hot water heater's control valve. The required length of the drip leg varies. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require less repairs with time.

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

Feed products in a little at a time, and wait till they grind and run through totally prior to adding more. Never put bacon grease, coffee grounds or oils down your kitchen drain, and constantly make certain you run a lot of thin down the drain after each usage. It is very important to know how to keep and care for your all your house's plumbing components and systems to keep things running smoothly.</p>
