<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its typical flow. IRWD's drinkable water supply is created to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "normal," the direction of water flow can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the capacity for contaminated water going into the safe and clean water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic material, which indicates germs will not grow on it. Copper has been used (along with PVC pipes) because the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old structures. It is particularly useful for hot and cold tap water and refrigerant lines in HEATING AND COOLING systems.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
