<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
