It typically symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation if you observe low water pressure or tarnished water. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, affecting the water quality.

This is a great indication that your pipes might be rusting from the within and for that reason, need to be changed. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water just comes with warm water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
