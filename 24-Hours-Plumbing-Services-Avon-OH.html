<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Avon OH</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
