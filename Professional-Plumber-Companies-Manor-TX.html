It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best 1st experience with the start of our house improvements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific needs for our house. I will always utilize them and request for George particularly for all future problems or repairs. They were prompt and provided excellent prices for what we needed done. I highly suggest this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>If you're reasonably unskilled, a hot water heater installation is not the repair on which to sharpen your plumbing skills. So save yourself some major trouble by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is. The majority of backflow preventers are created to permit the components to be eliminated for repair while the main body remains installed in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not required for the most part. Some components such as relief valve bodies might need to be eliminated from the main body to help with a repair. Understanding the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
