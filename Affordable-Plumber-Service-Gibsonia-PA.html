<p>Are you sure it's safe for the types of pipes and fixtures in your home? The incorrect type can harm or damage them. It may be required to clean your kitchen drain's P-trap to clear the clog. The P-trap is at the curve of the drainpipe under the sink, typically inside a cabinet. Place a pan or bucket underneath the drain to catch any water or particles that may fall out.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

We suggest installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to notify you of any potential gas leaks if you have not done so currently.</p>
