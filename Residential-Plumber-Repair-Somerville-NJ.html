In a different drain pathway, small pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet a larger one below the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home. A terrific way to reduce the quantity of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Quickly and effectively eliminating remaining potato peels, fruit rinds and many other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds everything into fine particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into your house drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>
