<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
