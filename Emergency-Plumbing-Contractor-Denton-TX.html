<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement typically will not require added fees, such as application fees. New meters need to fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers may need an unique meter for their services, limiting your choices. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the structure license. Inspections must be made after foundation excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon completion. NOTE: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will provide an infraction notification, and a particular amount of time is set aside to remedy the issue.</p>
