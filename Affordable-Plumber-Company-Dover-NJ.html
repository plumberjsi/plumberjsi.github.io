Use a large bowl or other durable object to prop up the unit as you place it. Water softeners usually have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are effectively preserved. Ensuring the brine tank never ever lacks salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the unit.

<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they normally occur in the lowest open drain. This kind of problem is usually the result of a clog in the line. If you don't find the odor originating from the sewer backup, you may identify this problem because a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, nevertheless, only one drain has backup problems, there's a separated problem with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
