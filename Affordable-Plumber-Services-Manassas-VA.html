<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense.

When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge.
