<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable water system and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An approved, appropriately set up and kept backflow assembly basically eliminates the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any considerable changes in the cost savings a gas heater will bring.
