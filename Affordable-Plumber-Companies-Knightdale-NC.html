<h3>Septic Tank Repair in Knightdale North Carolina</h2>
<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside if either check valve must leak.
