<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

Normally, the very first two numbers indicate the year of your water heater.</p>

Warm water can trigger things like grease, oil, and starches to melt and pass through the disposal, however they will just solidify even more on down the drain, potentially causing a clog.

Excavation: If the pipe is hard to gain access to, it can cost $1,000 to $5,000 to get to the leak due to excavation costs.</p>
