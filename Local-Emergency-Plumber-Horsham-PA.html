<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
