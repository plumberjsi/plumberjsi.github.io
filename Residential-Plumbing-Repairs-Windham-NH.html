<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to eliminate wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the earliest known examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily removable and changeable sections, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
