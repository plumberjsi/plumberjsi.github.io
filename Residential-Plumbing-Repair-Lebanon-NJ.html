<p>This ion exchange procedure is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another combination that can deal with sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this process if it doesn't work the very first time. We do warm water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Once again, it is recommended to inspect the manufacturer's guidelines for special precautions.</p>
