Although it's a huge job, changing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, utility, or basement  room is relatively straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets should definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>

<p>You'll need an unique garbage disposal if you home uses a septic system and drain field. The system must grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but must then transition to galvanized. I am not sure why that should be. It is likewise permitted to use black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized finish (which is generally a special paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E typically does this.</p>
<p>Additionally, you must constantly run cold water while the waste disposal unit is on to ensure that food bits are completely pressed through.
