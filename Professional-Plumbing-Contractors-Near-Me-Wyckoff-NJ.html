If it was built before 1970, it may have pipes made from an out-of-date product that will start to give you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't currently).

Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything is in great shape.</p>
