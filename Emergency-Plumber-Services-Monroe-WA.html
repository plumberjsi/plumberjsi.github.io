This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves).

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
