It also implies the very best parts and items, as well as the greatest level of complete satisfaction we can summon. The client has 30 days to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (inspect the due date on Notice of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After an initial inspection and testing of a freshly installed backflow preventer, the water client is required to have the backflow preventer checked on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
