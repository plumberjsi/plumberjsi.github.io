Smaller sized households and individuals might do much better with an electrical hot water heater, or an on-demand tankless" hot water heater as explained in the area below.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems.

Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
