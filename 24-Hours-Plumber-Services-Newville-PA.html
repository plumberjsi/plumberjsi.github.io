<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ).
