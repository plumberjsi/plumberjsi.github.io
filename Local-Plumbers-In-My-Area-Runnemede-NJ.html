In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any leftover impurities.</p>

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and harden or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
