<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water circulation, happens. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to get away. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
