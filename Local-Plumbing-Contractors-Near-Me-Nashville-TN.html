<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds.
