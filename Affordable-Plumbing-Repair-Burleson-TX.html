<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they normally happen in the lowest open drain. This type of problem is usually the result of an obstruction in the line. If you don't find the odor originating from the sewer backup, you might determine this issue since a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated issue with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
