<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
