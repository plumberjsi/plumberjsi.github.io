<p>To assist prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the technique laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
