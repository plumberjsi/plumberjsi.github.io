<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they generally occur in the lowest open drain. This type of problem is typically the outcome of an obstruction in the line.

Every drain in your home is dependent upon the main sewer line for correct drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated concern with just that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
