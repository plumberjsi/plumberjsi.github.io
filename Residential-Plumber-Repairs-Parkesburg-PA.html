<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that should likewise be well maintained to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and solidify or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
