<p>This type of valve is utilized on farming areas. It is indicated to keep the local supply of water clean in the presence of numerous farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals.

Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are offered. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
