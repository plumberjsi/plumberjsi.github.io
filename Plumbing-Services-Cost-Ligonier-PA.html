<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>After removing standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with warm water to clear the mixture. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water home appliances? This is a good sign that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be changed. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water only features hot water, the cause could be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
