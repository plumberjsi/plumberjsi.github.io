<p>A couple of local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It may not be installed in any location where it may ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not enable the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some do not permit the use of a PVB at all, so consult your water company. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it needs to be set up in an area where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found extensive use because it avoids both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are set up in line with the pipeline and run individually of each other. A set of 4 test cocks enable the operator to examine the valves and make certain they are not being required open by built up debris.
