<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>IRWD is dedicated to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our clients is kept devoid of harmful pollutants.
