<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
