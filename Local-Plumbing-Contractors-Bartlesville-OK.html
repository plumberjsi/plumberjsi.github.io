Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the structure authorization. Inspections need to be made after foundation excavation (before putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion.

Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
