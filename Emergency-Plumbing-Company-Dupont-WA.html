<p>The waste disposal unit is humming, but not turning. The waste disposal unit has become jammed. NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL if IT IS JAMMED. Even if the unit is off, the blades are hazardous and sharp. Make sure the system is off, you can even shut off the breaker to ensure it can't be turned on by mishap. Your garbage disposal comes with a. hex wrench that can be used to insert into the opening situated at the bottom of the unit. If you can't find this wrench, then attempt to place a broom handle or plunger into the sink drain opening and attempt to turn the jammed flywheel. If it seems to be moving freely turn the unit back on (and do not forget to turn back on the breaker if you don't it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
