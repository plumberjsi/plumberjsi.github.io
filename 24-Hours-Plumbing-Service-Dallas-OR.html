<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the concern. You might need to check out using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
