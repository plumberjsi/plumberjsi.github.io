<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
