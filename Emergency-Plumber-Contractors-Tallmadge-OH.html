Your waste disposal unit includes a. hex wrench that can be utilized to insert into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. If you can't find this wrench, then attempt to insert a broom plunger or handle into the sink drain opening and attempt to turn the jammed flywheel. If it appears to be moving freely turn the system back on (and don't forget to turn back on the breaker if you don't it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
