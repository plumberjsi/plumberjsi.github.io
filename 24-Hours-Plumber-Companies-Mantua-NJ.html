<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
