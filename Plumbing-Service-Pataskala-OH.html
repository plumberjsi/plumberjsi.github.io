If the easy unclogging techniques don't work to fix the slow drain, the concern can be a much deeper blockage someplace in the main sewer line.

In basic, it's an economical solution that will stand the test of time. We typically recommend this product, though it will depend.</p>

But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs.
