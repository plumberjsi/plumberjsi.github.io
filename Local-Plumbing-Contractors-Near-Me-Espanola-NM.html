<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
