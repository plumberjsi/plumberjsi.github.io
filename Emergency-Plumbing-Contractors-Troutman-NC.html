<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
