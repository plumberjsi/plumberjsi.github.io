<p>Normal causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root invasion, obstructions (such as foreign items, toilet tissue, grease, and other particles), wear and tear, and broken seals or joints in between sections of sewer line. Property owners are responsible for maintaining, fixing, and replacing natural gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the house's natural gas devices. When the source of a gas leak or other issue is on a client's gas pipe or related connections, repair costs can be high.</p>

We recommend installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to alert you of any possible gas leaks if you haven't done so already.</p>
