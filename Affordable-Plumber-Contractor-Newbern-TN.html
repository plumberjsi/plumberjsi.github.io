<p>We specialize in storm drain inspections and cleaning. Softened water is not recommended for watering home gardens, plants and lawns due to its sodium material. Water utilized in charging a water softener may overload or decrease the efficiency of little septic or sewer systems. Sodium consumption may pose health risks. Softened water is not suggested for steam irons or evaporative coolers. The very best option for such appliances is distilled water or water from a reverse osmosis unit.

<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it tough to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or energy  room is relatively simple, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
