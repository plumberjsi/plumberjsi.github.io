When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your home.

Salt is generally used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
