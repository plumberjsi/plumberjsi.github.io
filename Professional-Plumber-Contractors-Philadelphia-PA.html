If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you should require to safeguard yourself, your household and your home.

For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
