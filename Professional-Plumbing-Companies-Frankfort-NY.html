<p>You'll need a special waste disposal unit if you home utilizes a septic system and drain field. The system must grind the waste even finer to avoid blockages and enable the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then transition to galvanized. I am not sure why that need to be.
