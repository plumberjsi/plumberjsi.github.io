All the products will fix up the interior of your pipes without having to entirely replace them. How old is the plumbing in your home? Well, very first let's ask you a different question: How old is your home? If it was developed prior to 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will start to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not currently). And if the house was built before World War II, then it probably needs replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>If you have a more recent unit, an easy repair or changing specific parts may be all that's required to get your water heater working again. You might be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save cash. While this may operate in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the same material as other pipes in your house, suggesting that difficulty might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>
