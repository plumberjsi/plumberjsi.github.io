Read our evaluations to see what people are saying about our hot water heater services. If your hot water heater has needed several repairs over the last couple of years, it might be time to get it replaced. A great general rule for water heaters is this: since the life expectancy of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>For a garbage disposal with a factory-installed cord, merely plug in to the outlet under your sink after completing the remainder of the steps. 106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a component, system, or sub-system  group is replaced, a permit and inspection will not be needed.
