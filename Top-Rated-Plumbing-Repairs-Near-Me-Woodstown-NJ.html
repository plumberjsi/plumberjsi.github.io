Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in a lot of homes and accounts for over 30 percent of total household water consumption. Toilets made prior to the 1980s might use up to seven gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the job and still squandering water. Later models from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>The other difference in between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals only crush the food in batches (hence the name)-- not at one time like a continuous feed waste disposal unit.
