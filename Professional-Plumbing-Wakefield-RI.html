<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
