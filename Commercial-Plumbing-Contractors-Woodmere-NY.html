Call (866) 701-5306 to schedule a consultation. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly specified by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
