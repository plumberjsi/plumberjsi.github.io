<p>There are 2 popular install systems used for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt install (if you have actually had a disposer installed for a long time, it's probably installed this way) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the exact same task with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name implies, the EZ Mount system is planned to be simpler to handle when setting up or fixing a system.</p>

Before leaving the house, the technician brought back water circulation and evaluated the pipe.</p>
