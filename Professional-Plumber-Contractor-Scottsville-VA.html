<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid typically will help eliminate them. If you would like to attempt the gentlest approach perhaps try using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't suffice then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to check out the instructions and security cautions first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust stains and it's readily available at the majority of hardware stores.</p>
