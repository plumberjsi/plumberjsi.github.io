<p>An air pressure test is required. The test pressure shall be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test period shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will withstand the test pressure defined without revealing any proof of leak or other defects. Mechanical gauges utilized to determine test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will need a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not suggest the minimum pressure needed for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as suggested by pressure gauges during inspection will be deemed to indicate the presence of a leak.</p>
