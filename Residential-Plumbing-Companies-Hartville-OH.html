<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
