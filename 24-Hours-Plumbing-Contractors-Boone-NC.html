<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
