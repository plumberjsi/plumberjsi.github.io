<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid generally will assist eliminate them. If you wish to attempt the gentlest approach perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security warnings initially!), if that doesn't do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust stains and it's easily available at a lot of hardware stores.</p>
