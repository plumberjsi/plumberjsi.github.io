<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your home.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
