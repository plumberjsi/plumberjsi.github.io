The pro will next check your hot water heater. With your water heater, he or she is taking a look at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ). Some will also flush your hot water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance job that avoids tough water and sediment buildup. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any accumulation.</p>
<p>1. Install a lint-catcher: Your washing machine's water line is accountable for bringing the water out of the machine after it's done washing.
