<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
